# VisualAnalytics

We created this project for the exam "Visual Analytics" of the "Engineering in Computer Science" master degree.

In order to start the project for the Visual Analytics course, we searched for some datasets on internet and at the end we found a very interesting one on the web site UCI Machine Learning Repository:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php

Thanks to this, or better thanks to the information that the dataset gives us, we develop some important features for our project such as “visualization” with coordinated graphs or “analytics” having interactive contents.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5 CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

As we said before, among all the available datasets on the web site we choose the one dealing with the “Heart Disease” (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease).

The dataset contains 918 records with 12 attributes, selected by all published experiments over the 76 initial ones. 
For every person we have:

Age: age of the patient [years]
Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]
ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]
Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]
FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]
RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]
MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]
ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]
ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]
HeartDisease: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]
