# VisualAnalytics

We created this project for the exam "Visual Analytics" of the "Engineering in Computer Science" master degree.

In order to start the project for the Visual Analytics course, we searched for some datasets on internet and at the end we found a very interesting one on the web site UCI Machine Learning Repository:

Thanks to this, or better thanks to the information that the dataset gives us, we develop some important features for our project such as “visualization” with coordinated graphs or “analytics” having interactive contents.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5 CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.
